 * Drupal site-specific configuration file.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * This file may have been set to read-only by the Drupal installation program.
 * If you make changes to this file, be sure to protect it again after making
 * your modifications. Failure to remove write permissions to this file is a
 * security risk.
 *
 * In order to use the selection rules below the multisite aliasing file named
 * sites/sites.php must be present. Its optional settings will be loaded, and
 * the aliases in the array $sites will override the default directory rules
 * below. See sites/example.sites.php for more information about aliases.
 *
 * The configuration directory will be discovered by stripping the website's
 * hostname from left to right and pathname from right to left. The first
 * configuration file found will be used and any others will be ignored. If no
 * other configuration file is found then the default configuration file at
 * 'sites/default' will be used.
 *
 * For example, for a fictitious site installed at
 * https://www.drupal.org:8080/mysite/test/, the 'settings.php' file is searched
 * for in the following directories:
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/www.drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/org.mysite.test
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/www.drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/org.mysite
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org
 * - sites/www.drupal.org
 * - sites/drupal.org
 * - sites/org
 *
 * - sites/default
 *
 * Note that if you are installing on a non-standard port number, prefix the
 * hostname with that number. For example,
 * https://www.drupal.org:8080/mysite/test/ could be loaded from
 * sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test/.
 *
 * @see example.sites.php
 * @see \Drupal\Core\DrupalKernel::getSitePath()
 *
 * In addition to customizing application settings through variables in
 * settings.php, you can create a services.yml file in the same directory to
 * register custom, site-specific service definitions and/or swap out default
 * implementations with custom ones.

/**
 * Database settings:
 *
 * The $databases array specifies the database connection or
 * connections that Drupal may use.  Drupal is able to connect
 * to multiple databases, including multiple types of databases,
 * during the same request.
 *
 * One example of the simplest connection array is shown below. To use the
 * sample settings, copy and uncomment the code below between the @code and
 * @endcode lines and paste it after the $databases declaration. You will need
 * to replace the database username and password and possibly the host and port
 * with the appropriate credentials for your database system.
 *
 * The next section describes how to customize the $databases array for more
 * specific needs.
 *
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = [
 *   'database' => 'databasename',
 *   'username' => 'sqlusername',
 *   'password' => 'sqlpassword',
 *   'host' => 'localhost',
 *   'port' => '3306',
 *   'driver' => 'mysql',
 *   'prefix' => '',
 *   'collation' => 'utf8mb4_general_ci',
 * ];
 * @endcode
 */


/**
 * Customizing database settings.
 *
 * Many of the values of the $databases array can be customized for your
 * particular database system. Refer to the sample in the section above as a
 * starting point.
 *
 * The "driver" property indicates what Drupal database driver the
 * connection should use.  This is usually the same as the name of the
 * database type, such as mysql or sqlite, but not always.  The other
 * properties will vary depending on the driver.  For SQLite, you must
 * specify a database file name in a directory that is writable by the
 * webserver.  For most other drivers, you must specify a
 * username, password, host, and database name.
 *
 * Drupal core implements drivers for mysql, pgsql, and sqlite. Other drivers
 * can be provided by contributed or custom modules. To use a contributed or
 * custom driver, the "namespace" property must be set to the namespace of the
 * driver. The code in this namespace must be autoloadable prior to connecting
 * to the database, and therefore, prior to when module root namespaces are
 * added to the autoloader. To add the driver's namespace to the autoloader,
 * set the "autoload" property to the PSR-4 base directory of the driver's
 * namespace. This is optional for projects managed with Composer if the
 * driver's namespace is in Composer's autoloader.
 *
 * For each database, you may optionally specify multiple "target" databases.
 * A target database allows Drupal to try to send certain queries to a
 * different database if it can but fall back to the default connection if not.
 * That is useful for primary/replica replication, as Drupal may try to connect
 * to a replica server when appropriate and if one is not available will simply
 * fall back to the single primary server (The terms primary/replica are
 * traditionally referred to as master/slave in database server documentation).
 *
 * The general format for the $databases array is as follows:
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = $info_array;
 * $databases['default']['replica'][] = $info_array;
 * $databases['default']['replica'][] = $info_array;
 * $databases['extra']['default'] = $info_array;
 * @endcode
 *
 * In the above example, $info_array is an array of settings described above.
 * The first line sets a "default" database that has one primary database
 * (the second level default).  The second and third lines create an array
 * of potential replica databases.  Drupal will select one at random for a given
 * request as needed.  The fourth line creates a new database with a name of
 * "extra".
 *
 * You can optionally set a prefix for all database table names by using the
 * 'prefix' setting. If a prefix is specified, the table name will be prepended
 * with its value. Be sure to use valid database characters only, usually
 * alphanumeric and underscore. If no prefix is desired, do not set the 'prefix'
 * key or set its value to an empty string ''.
 *
 * For example, to have all database table prefixed with 'main_', set:
 * @code
 *   'prefix' => 'main_',
 * @endcode
 *
 * Advanced users can add or override initial commands to execute when
 * connecting to the database server, as well as PDO connection settings. For
 * example, to enable MySQL SELECT queries to exceed the max_join_size system
 * variable, and to reduce the database connection timeout to 5 seconds:
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = [
 *   'init_commands' => [
 *     'big_selects' => 'SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1',
 *   ],
 *   'pdo' => [
 *     PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT => 5,
 *   ],
 * ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * WARNING: The above defaults are designed for database portability. Changing
 * them may cause unexpected behavior, including potential data loss. See
 * https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/database/configuration for more
 * information on these defaults and the potential issues.
 *
 * More details can be found in the constructor methods for each driver:
 * - \Drupal\mysql\Driver\Database\mysql\Connection::__construct()
 * - \Drupal\pgsql\Driver\Database\pgsql\Connection::__construct()
 * - \Drupal\sqlite\Driver\Database\sqlite\Connection::__construct()
 *
 * Sample Database configuration format for PostgreSQL (pgsql):
 * @code
 *   $databases['default']['default'] = [
 *     'driver' => 'pgsql',
 *     'database' => 'databasename',
 *     'username' => 'sqlusername',
 *     'password' => 'sqlpassword',
 *     'host' => 'localhost',
 *     'prefix' => '',
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * Sample Database configuration format for SQLite (sqlite):
 * @code
 *   $databases['default']['default'] = [
 *     'driver' => 'sqlite',
 *     'database' => '/path/to/databasefilename',
 *   ];
 * @endcode
 *
 * Sample Database configuration format for a driver in a contributed module:
 * @code
 *   $databases['default']['default'] = [
 *     'driver' => 'my_driver',
 *     'namespace' => 'Drupal\my_module\Driver\Database\my_driver',
 *     'autoload' => 'modules/my_module/src/Driver/Database/my_driver/',
 *     'database' => 'databasename',
 *     'username' => 'sqlusername',
 *     'password' => 'sqlpassword',
 *     'host' => 'localhost',
 *     'prefix' => '',
 *   ];
 * @endcode
